## 3D Anatomical Visualization
### Description
This project is a 3D anatomical visualization tool built using React, React Three Fiber, and @react-three/drei. It's designed to provide an interactive 3D representation of anatomical structures, with a focus on the human scapula. Users can manipulate a 3D model of the scapula and a sphere representing a joint or point of interest in real-time, observing the anatomical relationships from different perspectives.

### Features
Interactive 3D model of a human scapula.
Real-time manipulation of the model along the Medial/Lateral, Superior/Inferior, and Anterior/Posterior axes.
Responsive design for both desktop and mobile devices.
Incremental adjustments with clear UI controls.

### Usage
The application allows users to interact with the 3D model using on-screen controls. Adjustments can be made along the specified axes using increment and decrement buttons, providing detailed control over the model's orientation and position.
